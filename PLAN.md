# SportsSim — Master Plan 🦞

## Mission
Build the ultimate +EV sports betting platform across ALL sports, ALL markets. Find every edge. Make maximum money.

## Sports Coverage (Priority Order)

### 🏀 NBA (NOW — Playoffs starting April)
- Regular season ending, playoff seeding battles = volatile lines
- Focus: spreads, totals, team totals (Kalshi), player props, futures
- Playoff series pricing is historically inefficient

### ⚾ MLB (OPENING DAY MARCH 27 — IMMINENT)
- 162-game season = massive sample size = model heaven
- Focus: moneylines (no spread in baseball), totals, first 5 innings (F5), player props
- Pitching matchups are EVERYTHING — starting pitcher drives 60%+ of the line
- Weather, park factors, bullpen usage, platoon splits
- Run line (+/- 1.5) often mispriced

### 🏒 NHL (NOW — Playoffs starting April)
- Similar to NBA: Pythagorean model works, puck line (+/- 1.5)
- Goalie matchups are key — backup vs starter swings lines massively
- Totals market is soft — pace and shooting % drive it
- Playoff series pricing = edges

### 🏈 NFL (September — but prep NOW)
- Most bet sport = sharpest lines BUT most public money = exploitable
- Focus: spreads, totals, player props, futures
- Off-season: draft positioning, win totals futures, division odds
- Key edges: weather, rest advantages, short weeks, travel

### ⚽ Soccer (Year-round)
- EPL, La Liga, Champions League, MLS
- Draw is underbet by public — 3-way moneyline has edges
- Asian handicap markets

### 🥊 UFC/MMA (Every few weeks)
- Massive line movement, public overreacts to hype
- Prop markets are soft (method of victory, round betting)

### 🎾 Tennis (Year-round)
- Set betting, game spreads — high volume, soft markets
- Surface specialist edges (clay vs hard court)

### 📊 Prediction Markets
- Kalshi: team totals, props, event markets
- Polymarket: politics, events, crypto
- Wide bid-ask spreads = edge for patient players

## Architecture

### Core Engine
1. **Universal Model Framework** — Sport-agnostic rating system that plugs in sport-specific features
2. **Odds Aggregator** — Real-time from DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, Caesars, PointsBet, Pinnacle, Kalshi
3. **Value Engine** — Model vs. book comparison, edge calculation, confidence scoring
4. **Bankroll Optimizer** — Kelly Criterion across all sports, portfolio-level risk management
5. **Backtest Suite** — Historical validation per sport per market type
6. **Dashboard** — All sports, all edges, sorted by EV
7. **Alert System** — Instant push when high-value bets appear

### Model Philosophy
- **Point/run/goal differential** > win/loss record (Pythagorean for every sport)
- **Rolling windows** — recent form matters more than season-long
- **Luck identification** — teams that will regress (close game variance)
- **Key player impact** — injuries/rest/matchups
- **Market-specific modeling** — different math for spreads vs totals vs props
- **Closing Line Value (CLV)** — the ultimate measure of model quality
- **Ensemble approach** — combine multiple models, weight by recent accuracy

### Math Stack
- Logistic regression → win probability
- Poisson/negative binomial → totals and scoring distributions
- Monte Carlo → game simulation and score distributions
- Bradley-Terry → head-to-head strength ratings
- Elo with K-factor tuning → universal rating system
- LASSO/Ridge → feature selection for props
- Bayesian updating → in-season calibration
- Copula models → correlation for same-game parlays
- Kelly Criterion → optimal bet sizing across portfolio

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Professional dashboard (dark theme, real-time updates)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express API
- **Database:** SQLite → PostgreSQL
- **Odds:** The Odds API (50+ books), Kalshi API, OddsJam
- **Stats:** NBA API, MLB Statcast, NHL API, ESPN, Pro Football Reference
- **Hosting:** Fly.io at sportssim.hatch.fun
- **Repo:** github.com/William-Metz/sportssim
- **Alerts:** Telegram/WhatsApp/Claw Hub
